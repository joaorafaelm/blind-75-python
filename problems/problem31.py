Blind Curated 75 - Problem 31
=============================

Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
----------------------------

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting
node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must
contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.
